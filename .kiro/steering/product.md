# About this project

I vibecoded this website on replit.  Replit costs me $25/mo for something that I am pretty sure I can run on AWS for much, much less at my small scale.   The focus of this project for now is to get it transformed and deployed on AWS, which will give me much better long-term costs.  Scale-to-zero cost is my main goal here.

This is a learning project so that I can learn about Kiro and AWS MCP tools and how they work for this kind of workload migration as of today (Feb 2026).

# The Complaints Dept

This website is the grievance portal for the Complaints Department.  It is tongue-in-cheek.

Anyone with a complaint is welcome to submit one to our Complaints Department for a nominal processing fee of $5 per complaint.  The Complaints Dept produces an AI-generated thoughtful and officious, though ultimately noncommittal and unactionable, response.

The application has a real Stripe integration, though it is with a Stripe sandbox.  Nobody actually gets charged money here.  Users are instructed to use Stripe's fake credit card number 4242 42... and any values for the other fields.

There is also the beginning of an admin portal.  This is for admins who, after authenticating, can review submitted complaints and responses.
